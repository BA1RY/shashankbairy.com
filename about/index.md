Hi! I'm Shashank Bairy. I'm a full stack developer building open-source projects and writing about programming. I'm currently in senior year pursuing Information Science Engineering at R V College of Engineering, Bengaluru.

My favorite technologies right now are Javascript, Python, React, Node.js and Django.

Purpose of this blog is to share what's on my mind and my learnings with the community.

Cheers üçª
