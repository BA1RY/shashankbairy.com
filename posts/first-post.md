Welcome to my online space. Here I write about what's on my mind and my technical learnings. It's always been a desire of mine to create a blog and I've finally created one. Sharing my thoughts and learnings here is my way of giving back to the online tech community.

My interest is Full Stack Development and I primarily code using Javascript and Python. Go has gained my interest recently. So most of my blog posts will be geared towards these technologies.

Being very much interested in the world of open source, I always try to contribute to it when I can. The joy of getting your pull request merged to a popular repo is unexplainable and satisfying.

Since I'm still a student, I'm feeling that my words are not backed with the experience to teach anyone anything. But, everyone has to start somewhere initially and this is my first step at it.

That's all for now. Cheers! ðŸ˜ƒ
